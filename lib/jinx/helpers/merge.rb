class Hash
  # Returns a new hash which merges the other hash with this hash.
  #
  # Supported options include the following:
  # * :deep - merge values which match on the key.
  # If the :deep option is set, and a key matches both this hash and the other hash
  # on hash values, then the other hash's value is recursively merged into this Hash's
  # value using the non-destructive {#merge} method with the deep option set.
  # If a block is given to this method, then the block is passed to the value merge.
  #
  # @example
  #   {:a => [1], :b => [2]}.merge({:b => [3]}, :deep) #=> {:a => [1], :b => [2, 3]}
  #   {:a => {:b => [1]}}.merge({:a => {:b => [2]}, :c => 3}, :deep) #=> {:a => {:b => [1, 2]}, :c => 3}
