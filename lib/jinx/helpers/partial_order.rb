module CaRuby
  # A PartialOrder is a Comparable which restricted scope. Classes which include PartialOrder
  # are required to implement the <=> operator with the following semantics:
  # *  _a_ <=> _b_ returns -1, 0, or 1 if a and b are comparable, nil otherwise
  # A PartialOrder thus relaxes comparison symmetry, e.g.
  #   a < b
  # does not imply
  #   b >= a.
  # Example:
  #   module Queued
  #     attr_reader :queue
  #     def <=>(other)
  #       queue.index(self) <=> queue.index(other) if queue.equal?(other.queue)
  #     end
  #   end
  #   q1 = [a, b] # a, b are Queued
  #   q2 = [c]    # c is a Queued
  #   a < b #=> true
  #   b < c #=> nil
